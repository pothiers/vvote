This is stripped down code to import LVR files in CSV format (often
"*CVR*.csv) into an SQLITE database.


*** Specifications and definitions
- CVR :: Cast Vote Record, election system ballot interpretation (for
     one ballot)
- LVR :: List of CVR records (an excel file, each row is CVR except
     header row=1)
- undervote :: label used in Excel LVR file for all the choices that
     were not made on the ballot. If the ballot said "Vote for not
     more than three", and only one candiate was chosen, there would
     be two "undervote" values.
- overvote :: if more than max number of choices made, the ballot is
     not counted and is not in the LVR file.
- Write-in :: label used in LVR where the original ballot had a
     write-in value
- blank cell :: voter not able to vote in that contest (out of
     district, or fed-only voter)
